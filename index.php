		<hr>
		<div class="b">
			<p>We are more than a community, we're a community, a brotherhood, and more importantly a family. The Infected was founded in 2019 by Rusty Joker to give people the ultimate DayZ experience.</p>
			<p>This is the place we all come and gather to still be a 'kid' and enjoy fellowship among friends, sharing beers and video games and all kinds of funny shenanigans. We welcome the young and the old, though we do have a policy that all members must be 18 or older, simply out of respect that we may engage often in adult conversation, use expletives. But we appreciate gamers from all ages and demographics. Pretty much anything goes with us, as long as we honor the core value that holds our community together: Respect.<br></p>
			<p>While we don't really have a charter of rules per se', we operate on one very simple one that hopefully most people are familiar with. Treat others, how you want to be treated. Things like racism, misogyny, and general 'dickish' behavior will not be tolerated here. We can break this rule down even further for you if it helps. DONT BE AN ****! This rule goes outside of our community, as well as internally. Respect fellow gamers. Remember that people who see you wearing our tag are going to make judgments on our community based on how you behave. You carry the reputation of the community with you, and we carry your reputation with us as well. Beyond that, anything goes. We like conversation. But if you're going to engage in something controversial, do so with an open mind. If you offer your opinion on something, be ready to hear the opinion of others.</p>
			<p>While we encourage and appreciate activity, we are adults, and understand that life will always come first before video games. This community does not have rules on activity out side of: if we don't see you for several months without warning, we're probably going to assume you've moved on. There are no mandatory meetings, no mandatory scrimages. But as with any community, what you get out of it will very often be what you put into it as well. There will be a place here for both casual gamers and hardcore gamers. We like to play tactically with teammates, using strategy to achieve a common goal. But if you like to just hop in and have mindless fun, this is a place for that too. We welcome all kinds of play styles, and encourage you to help cultivate a place for other like minded individuals within our community.</p></div>

			<div class="a">The Infected Server</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="b">
				<p>We offer a modded DayZ server that as the input from all of the community to give you the gaming experience you deserve. We are a fun and friendly server that does not KOS most of the time but if you want to be a bandit we do not discourage from it.</p>
				<p>We have 4 Trader locations on the server 2 of them are custom which we have do ourselves but in the future we would like to have real people being the traders and moving around the map to give everyone real feel of surviving. We have build a custom military base on the northeast airfield where you can find good loots. We have made loot, drink and food easier to find by making more loot spawn on the map. Custom bridges to Prison Island and Skalisty Island which we are looking to improve and make better.</p>
				<p> we offer some building mods such as “Build Everywhere”, “BaseBuildingPlus” etc. We would like to see what crazy and epic bases you can build. We also have a day and night cycle which night lasts for 30 mins. Everyone starts off with a custom load-out which you get NVG's, gun and a mag. So if this interests you come and join the community and server for some good fun what are you waiting for.</p>
